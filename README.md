## Project overview

* As a user, I want to be able to generate a roster, listing all managers/engineers/interns in my organization. I want to be able to list their name/id/email address as well as different data about each employee. I also want to display the employee information in an organized fashion and use icons to id their role. 

* I will submit employee information from a Node.js command line and an html file will be rendered at the end.

## Dependencies

* This application requires two npm packages: inquirer (for users) & jest (for developer tests).

* Upon application load, run 'npm install' from terminal.

## Building the code & node

* Testing 1-2-3, this application required tdd work-style for each of the employee groups. Tests were written, classes constructed and debugging occurred  until both tests and code worked well. I appreciated peer collaboration on building tests as I'm not sure tdd is my style of development.

## What I'm proud of most

* "Less is more" was a bit of the theme in this assignment. My index file was originally two files and it was becoming complicated linking the two files (export.modules wasn't cutting it). After agreeing I should try one file, a lot more code came easily.

* I have a function pushing each employee to an array and then I had a separate map function identifying employee role and creating html cards. I realized the two functions could work together. I'm happy with how I made a small edit/checked for accuracy before changing too much code. Overall I was able to reduce lines of code and better organize what the code does each time an employee is entered.

## Additional learnings

* I learned a lot about modules being inter-dependant with one another and how to ensure they communicated. I found a roadblock when I had my team array working and I knew I needed to write the html file, but how was I to go grab templates & cards from several files? A tutoring session to get me running in the right direction helped as well as reducing down to one index file vs two.
