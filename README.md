## Project overview

* As a user, I want to be able to submit information about my team of managers, engineers and students and generate a roster of their information. I want to be able to list their name/id/email address as well as different data about each employee class. I also want to display the employee information in an organized fashion and use icons to id their role. 

* I will submit employee information from a Node.js command line and an html file will be rendered at the end.

<a name="depend"></a>
## Dependencies

* This application requires two npm packages: inquirer (for users) & jest (for developers).

* Upon application load, run 'npm install' from terminal.

## Building the code & node

* Testing 1-2-3, this application required tdd work-style for each of the employee groups. Tests were written, classes constructed and debugging occurred  until both tests and code worked well.

## What I'm proud of most

* I respect

* I am proud

<a name="learnings"></a>
## Additional learnings

* I learned a lot about modules being inter-dependant with one another and how to ensure they communicated. I found a roadblock when I had my team array working and I knew I needed to write the html file, but how was I to go grab templates & cards from several files? A few maps & filters along the way helped out.

* I respect the course for teaching tdd & I prefer to code first. I will be asking a potential employer if they operate with tdd to ensure I set myself and the employer up for success.
